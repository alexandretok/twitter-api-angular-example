# Turing Challenge

This project is a frontend engineer challenge proposed by [Turing.com](Turing.com).

It consists of a simple responsive UI to visualize the last tweets from @makeschool, @newsycombinator and @ycombinator.

This project was done using Angular 7 and Bootstrap 4.

## Getting started

* First of all, you need to edit the file `config.json` and insert your Twitter API credentials.

* Next you need to install the project's dependencies. Simply execute `npm install` on your terminal from within the project's directory.

* After that, lift the internal Twitter API proxy by executing `npm start`. Leave that running for now and open another terminal.

* The next step is to install the Angular CLI globally. For that, you can execute `npm install -g @angular/cli` (you might need to use `sudo` if you're on Mac or Linux).

* Wrap it up by executing `ng serve` from within the project's directory and opening [http://localhost:4200/]([http://localhost:4200/]) on your browser.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
